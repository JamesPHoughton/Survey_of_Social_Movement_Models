# Potential issues for survey paper

The paper I want to write will cover existing models of social movements.

### Failure Modes


1. There are no (or not many) existing, published models of social movements
2. Models do not include enough information about structure or equations to be replicated
3. A recent, well-done, comprehensive survey already exists
    A survey was conducted in 1993 - Pamela Oliver
4. There are way too many models to survey
5. I can't get it finished in time
6. It gets way too long


### Strategy
1. Research and read previous surveys
2. Look at past papers in the target



### Per-paper tasks
1. Read
2. Annotate Assumptions and Boundary Conditions
3. Annotate Timescales
4. Annotate Equations
