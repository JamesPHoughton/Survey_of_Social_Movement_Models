    "Models of crowds are a related but probably distinct type of modeling, as they are interested not in the macrobehavior of movements over timescales of weeks to years, but the behavior of groups of people on the order of minutes to hours. It will probably be important to understand how meaningful these distinctions are, and the similarities between each type of model.\n",
